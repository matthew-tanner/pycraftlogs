## PyCraftLogs

Basic script for working with warcraftlogs.com API. The current API is very basic and the beginings of this script are to just confirm access and the pull of data with each API function.

## Settings
All test data is hard coded into the script currently.

API Key - you will need to insert your own WCL API key into the script.
key = "123456"
*This can be found in your account settings on warcraftlogs.com

## Future Plans
As the API is updated, I will continue to do tests against it. Eventually I plan to build this out into either a webapp or GUI based tool.
