## PyCraftLogs

Basic script for working with warcraftlogs.com API. The current API is very basic and the beginings of this script are to just confirm access and the pull of data with each API function.

## Settings
All test data is hard coded into the script currently.

## Future Plans
As the API is updated, I will continue to do tests against it. Eventually I plan to build this out into either a webapp or GUI based tool.
